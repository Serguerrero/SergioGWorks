# SergioGWorks

Hi my name is Sergio Guerrero and as of Spring of 2021 I am a Junior Majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington.
I have created this GitHub repository as a means to allow future employers and colleugues to view some of the work that I have done during my 
time at UTA. This repository will include some of the works that I have been assigned over the years and have been able to complete. 

Thanks!
